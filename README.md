# FixSysSet

This project began as a way to reenable the setting to see window contents while dragging since my company's login scripts keep disabling it (for absolutely no good reason I can find). It occurred to me that this could be a more generic tool that includes other settings such as drag sensitivity (see my DragSens project at https://github.com/paulmooreparks/DragSens).
